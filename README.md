# Landing Page Project

This Project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

JavaScript is used to dynamically create the navigation bar based on the sections in the HTML.

When a navigation link is pressed, the page scrolls down to the anchor or target section.
As opposed to simply jumping to the anchor which is the default.

When a section is around near the top of the viewport, it is activated.
The styling changes to indicate that this is near the top.
The link in the navigation bar that maps to that section is also activated.
